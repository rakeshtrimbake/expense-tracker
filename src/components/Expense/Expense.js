    In the final of 1995 Ranji Trophy, Tendulkar, captaining Bombay, scored 140 and 139 versus Punjab.[63]
    
    In the 1995–96 Irani Cup, he captained Mumbai against Rest of India.[63] His first double century (204*) was for Mumbai while playing against the visiting Australian team at the Brabourne Stadium in 1998.[30][64] He is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the Ranji, Irani, and Duleep Trophies).[65] Another double century was an innings of 233* against Tamil Nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 Ranji Trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.[66][67][68]
    
    In total, Tendulkar was part of five Ranji Trophy finals, in which Mumbai won 4.[63]
